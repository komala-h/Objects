    <description>Purpose: As a robust Due Diligence process is being created, there is both a review of data returned by Dow Jones of a segment of constituents in crmND as well as a proactive search of donors currently being cultivated for leadership gifts. This would be a first step in ensuring we have some trail of due diligence activity. Editable and viewable only by those with Gift Management and Prospect Management (including research) access.</description>
